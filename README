Notes on disassembler:

Openfilefordatatype() or whatever the nsdocument method name is -  
should check against the "file" shell command to see what type of file  
then use a registered "file parser" plugin

Open the app bundle, read all resources 
(icon,images,bundles,frameworksetc) open the default binary, parse  
sections, put code into blocks, pass blocks to visualizer, visualizer  
displays blocks

Apply hex patches.  Roll-back patches.

Allow editing of symbols, save as standard debug symbol formats.

Visualizers: call graph, outline (collapsible) view with arrow/links,  
hex view, ????

Parsers: mach-o binary, pe binary, elf binary

CPU emulators: x86, x86_64, ppc, ARM

Intel vs AT&T syntax

Need Plugin UI to disable plugins on startup, should be persistent  
file (provide a separate app to manage if main app crashes?)

Plugins should have info.plist entries for the prefs interface

Investigate Apple's documentation of nsbundle contexthelpforkey as it  
has info on help files
